- Hi, I’m Nick!
- I’m currently interested in finding a cyber security or software development position as I am a recent Computer Science graduate.
- I’m currently working towards obtaining my Comptia Sec+ & Net+ certifications as well as
  learning GO lang to keep expanding on my knowledge.
- I am currently trying to gather my previously completed schoolwork to upload here 
  on GitHub as well as trying to get a small portfolio website running.
